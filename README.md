# Hi - I'm Joe & I live in Cornwall, England.

## About Me

After a 20 year career in Finance & Data & Analytics, having always loved to take any opportunity to write code, the opportunity arose to switch career path to Software Development in 2024.

My Career Transition has been supported by Code Institute and Headforwards.

I'm currently on an intensive Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp.

I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to build responsive web applications.
