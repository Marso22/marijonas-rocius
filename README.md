# Hi - I'm Joe & I live in Cornwall, England.

## About Me

I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. After 20 years in finance and data-driven strategy, I made the exciting transition into software development, enabled by the Code Institute bootcamp and supported by Headforwards.

I love working with Python, JavaScript, SQL, and Django, building projects that combine data, automation, and web development. Always curious and eager to learn, I thrive on exploring new technologies and creating efficient, scalable solutions.

Letâ€™s build something awesomeâ€”feel free to connect or check out my latest projects! ðŸš€
